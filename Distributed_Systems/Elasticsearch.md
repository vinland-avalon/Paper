# Elasticsearch
## Elasticsearch and Lucene
Elasticsearch is built on top of Apache Lucene and extends its capabilities to provide a distributed, real-time, and scalable search and analytics engine. Elasticsearch handles cluster management, data distribution, and search coordination across multiple nodes, making it suitable for large-scale deployments. It also adds additional features like aggregations, distributed search, high availability, data replication, and RESTful APIs.  
Lucene is responsible for *Inverted Index, Indexing, Ranking and Scoring, Tokenization and analysis* and so on.
