# Recognizing Alcohol Poisoning
- Cold Clammy Skin
- Irregular Pulse
- Vomiting
- Blue-tinged Skin
- Inability to stay awake
# Dos and Donts
## DON'T!
- Inducing the person to vomit - since alcohol is already in the blood stream
- Drinking coffee - this will cause further dehydration and increase the impact of alcohol concentration in the bloodstream
- Letting the person sleep it off - lower body temperature can lead to hypothermia
- Helping them walk it off - alcohol compromises sense of balance and increases risk of physical harm
