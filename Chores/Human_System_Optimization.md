# How to SLEEP
## Theory
There are two factors that may affect our biological clock, namely **illumination** and **temperature**. The light as well as higher body temperature will wake us up. And after noon, our body temperature will reduce, leading to kip.
## Practice
- If you want to go into spirit faster, immerse yourself directly in sunlight for 2-10 minutes.
- Don't not get exposed to too much to light before bed time. If have to, red light is better. So you may need blue-blocker glasses.
- Observing sunset will help with sleep. Interesting.
- You can buy some "smart mattress" which will change temperature automatically to help with sleep.
# How to EAT (Fasting)
When to eat is as important as what to eat.
## intermittent fasting
The time you aborb food should be limited to a fixed, short duration. The ideal time is from 10 am to 18 pm. However, it is a little hard for most people. But you should at least not eat in one hour after wakeup and 2-3 hours before sleep.
# Learning
- **Making mistake** may help neurons to rewire, it is the process of learning.
- **Flow** is a good status for working, but may not for learning.
- **Neuroplasticity** is related to our ability to learn. It keeps active before the age of 25. And after then, we should try to maintain it. For example, keep the learning thing in small and adaptive size. Another interesting way is to **disturb vestibular system**(前庭神经系统). You can try sports which make you lose balance, including handstanding, skateboarding, yoga and gymnastics. The novelty experience helps.
- Not be too nervous or too relaxed when learning. If too nervous or anxious, try **Physiological Sigh**. Inhale twice and expel them all at once.
# Focusing
- Omega-3 EPA
- Release the willing to move with other part of your body. For example, stand when working.
- How you look at things will affect your mood. Looking down lead to relax and sleepy, while up lead to alerting. So, always place your computer at least above the height of your nose.
- Too much context switch will hurt your brain. So TikTok is bad. Keep the time you spend on smart phone within 60 minutes for teenagers and 120 minutes for adults.
- 17-minute meditation will improve your attention forever. Once in lifetime is enough.
