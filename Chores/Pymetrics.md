## What Is the Pymetrics Balloon Game?
The Pymetrics Balloon Game is the most famous game in the set of 12 Pymetrics games. It assesses your risk-taking and learning abilities through a series of 39 rounds that go as follows:
- You begin with a deflated balloon in one of 3 colors.
- You pump the balloon as many times as you wish. Each pump earns you $0.05.
- At each point, you may bank the sum you’ve earned and move on to the next balloon.
- However, if you have pumped too much and the balloon pops – you lose all that round’s money.
## What Does the Balloon Game Measure?
As I mentioned, the Pymetrics Balloon game measures two traits – risk-taking and learning.
### Risk-Taking
This trait is pretty clear – how much risk will you take before banking.
A candidate who manages to collect all the balloons but earns very low sums will be classified as cautious, whereas a candidate who tends to pop plenty of balloons but gains higher sums will be considered adventurous.
### Learning
Unlike risk-taking, it is not as intuitive to understand how the Pymetrics Balloon Game assesses learning.

However, when you look at the backstage of this game, this becomes apparent:
The balloons’ explosion patterns are not random. Well, at least not entirely.

What does this mean?

If you remember, I previously mentioned that balloons come in one of 3 colors. Each balloon color has a different explosion pattern (or probability). For instance, blue balloons have a chance of 1:10 to explode, and yellow ones have a chance of 1:25 to explode (these are not the real numbers, BTW).

While playing the game, if you put close attention and apply a methodical approach, you will begin to make sense of these patterns, and change your behavior accordingly.

## The Max Balloons Strategy for the Cautious Type
On the other hand, if you are required to demonstrate a cautious personality, you should opt to maximize your balloon collection, even if it costs you at losing possible gains.

To do so, it is recommended to use the following strategy:

Collect the first balloons quickly to create a “low threshold” for their explosion probability.
In the following rounds, steadily and slowly increase your pumps to find the balance between gaining money and preventing explosions.
You should aim to collect more balloons than average – around 30-31 balloons.
You should aim to collect the average sum of money – around $17-$18.

# Money Exchange Game #1
Money Exchange #1 measures a potential candidate's trust. In the game you are paired with another participant. You start with $10 and your partner has $0. You will be allowed to transfer money to the other participant. The amount of money will then be tripled. Your partner can then decide how much to give back to you. After, you must rate from a scale of 1 to 10 how fair you felt your partner to be.

# Money Exchange Game #2
Both you and your partner get $5, and one of you will get an extra $5.

You can decide whether to share that additional money with your partner.

In the second part, only you get the extra $5, and you can decide whether to share it with your partner or take his money instead.

Then you will be asked to rate the fairness of the transaction.

# Stop Game
In the "Stop Game" a series of stimuli appear on the screen, and you are asked to stop only when you see the red circle. The game is made to be challenging so as you progress you will see both red and green circles flash quickly on the screen. The game tests cognitive abilities such as impulse control, attention to detail, and reaction time. The game is designed to measure the player's ability to inhibit their natural response in order to follow specific instructions.

# Cards Game
The point of the "Cards Game" is to earn as much money as possible. You will start the card game with $2,000. You will be able to draw cards from any of the four decks. For each card you draw you will either gain or lose money. As you draw the cards you will start to see patterns emerge. This game gives your employer an idea of your learning skills, risk tolerance, and pattern recognition.

Game Tip: Patterns will start to appear so make sure you pay attention to them. When choosing different decks make sure you use strategy and don't just choose at random.
