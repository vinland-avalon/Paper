# [F1]()
The name F1 comes from genetics, where a Filial 1 hybrid is the first generation offspring resulting from a cross mating of distinctly different parental types.  
F1 is built on top of Spanner, which provides extremely scalable data storage, synchronous replication, and strong consistency and ordering properties. F1 inherits those features from Spanner and adds several more:  
- Distributed SQL queries, including joining data from external data sources  
- Transactionally consistent secondary indexes
- Asynchronous schema changes including database reorganizations
- Optimistic transactions
- Automatic change history recording and publishing
